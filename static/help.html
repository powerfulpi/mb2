    <p><h1>How It Works:</h1> <h2>When GGG (GoGuardGard) is enabled, (which it is not by default) anything you search is put into an about:blank pop-up. When you go to the window what the teacher watching you sees is the last page you were on. GGG <strong>DOES NOT</strong> make it look like you are doing work unless you were on a work page before going to the window. (ask whoever gave the browser to you for assistance if needed). Pages you go to are disguised however the page where the search bar is located is not. This means you should go to the main page with caution.</h2> </p>
